    description: `Juan Miguel is easily one of the more talented individuals I've had the pleasure of working with. He has a deep understanding of UX and could always translate this to meet the needs of the business, staff and customers. It goes without saying that he is a creative individual with a great technical aptitude, but his patience, collaborative nature and project management skills really set him apart. When working together, I was greatly impressed at his seeing several key projects through from start to finish, including a revamped main website, the launch of a new website featuring the new luxury brand and a customized itinerary tool - each were key drivers for the business's continuing success.`,
